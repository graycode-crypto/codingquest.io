# Hi World!
This small repo is just for fun. Is just me playing around with the excersises at [https://codingquest.io/](https://codingquest.io/).
I'm using JS since I'm working out my ES6 skills in order to jump to ReactJS and build some nice WebApps.

Enjoy this journey with me, and solve the quests your way too. It's fun and relaxing.
